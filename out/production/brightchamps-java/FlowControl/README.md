# What is FLow Control?

Control flow is a way to tell the program which instructions to execute and where to start and end. so the point is that control flow allows the program to run based on the execution path. Control flow is divided into several types, including certain conditions (branching), repeating blocks of code iteratively (looping), skipping some code and stopping at certain code, and defining functions.
