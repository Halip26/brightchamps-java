# WHAT IS FUNCTIONS?

  A functions in programming languange specially in Java is mini-program within a larger program.  It's a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. You can think of it as a tool that you can call on whenever you need to do that particular job.

## Here are some key things to know about functions

- They are reusable: You can call the same function multiple times throughout your program, without having to rewrite the code each time. This saves you time and effort, and makes your code more concise and organized.
- They can take input: Some functions take data as input, which they can then use to perform their task. For example, a function that calculates the area of a rectangle might take the length and width as input.
- They can return output: Some functions return a value as their output. For example, a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers might return the average as its output.
- They can be named: Functions are usually given names that describe what they do. This makes it easier to understand what the function is doing and how to use it.
